            Expected 16S sequences, based on Sanger sequencing.  Each sequence must have only the isolate name in the FASTA header, for mapping against the genomes.

    <p>This checks that the 16S sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing for a bunch of isolates actually match the 16S sequences in the final assembled and annotated genomes.  It checks that there are no duplicate 16S sequences within one isolate (possibly indicating contamination), and that there are no matches to unexpected 16S sequences from the same batch of isolates (possibly indicating a mixup on the plate).</p>

    <p>This uses BLASTN to compare the file of expected (i.e., Sanger-derived) 16S sequences to annotated 16S sequences (including partial ones) in all of the genomes in the genome set.</p>

    <p>The names of the isolates must be encoded in the files: for the 16S sequences (uploaded to KBase as an Assembly object), each sequence must have only the isolate name in the FASTA header.  Each genome in the genome set of all isolates must be named "isolate_name.genome".</p>

    <p>This method is based on a recommended manual protocol designed by Morgan Price.</p>
